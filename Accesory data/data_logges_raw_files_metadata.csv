% Raw files metadata info
% Comma separated file with the following fields
% Path: Path and file name to the file
% Ignore Flag: 1=> Ignore data of the specified interval. Default: 0
% Start offset days     |
% Start offset Hours    | Offset to apply to the first sample of the specified data interval, timestamps are computed by adding the offset
% Start offset Minutes  |

% Start offset days     |
% Start offset Hours    | Offset to apply to the last sample of the specified data interval, timestamps copmputed by linear interpolation between start and end offsets
% Start offset Minutes  |

% Data range start: First line in raw data to be offseted/ignored
% Data range end: Last line in raw data to be offseted/ignored, the 'end' flag is accepted meaning the last line of the file

% Set ignore flag to 1 if the file should not be used at all
% Set offset times adding sign to all entries (i.e. -1 day -3 hour -2 minutes)
% If there is entries to be ignored, set the first and last valid entries to something different than 1:end
% Remember not to use commas on comments
